# Weather API Client 🌦️

A robust Python-based weather application that fetches real-time weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.

This project was built to practice real-world backend engineering concepts such as:

* REST API integration
* JSON parsing
* modular architecture
* virtual environments
* dependency management
* timezone-aware programming
* logging
* exception handling
* Git & GitHub workflow

---

# Project Objective

The goal of this project was not just to display weather data, but to understand how real backend systems are structured and engineered.

The project focuses on:

* clean code organization
* safe API handling
* user input validation
* reliable error handling
* production-style logging
* secure secret management

# Core Engineering Concepts Implemented

## 1. REST API Integration

The application communicates with the OpenWeatherMap API using HTTP GET requests.

Example:

```python
response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params, timeout=10)
```

This helped in understanding:

* APIs
* HTTP requests
* query parameters
* JSON responses

---

## 2. JSON Parsing

The API returns nested JSON data which is parsed using Python dictionaries and lists.

Example:

```python
temp = data["main"]["temp"]
condition = data["weather"][0]["description"]
```

Concepts practiced:

* nested dictionaries
* list indexing
* structured data extraction

---

## 3. Modular Architecture

The project is separated into multiple files for cleaner architecture.

### `main.py`

Handles:

* user interaction
* displaying output

### `weather.py`

Handles:

* API communication
* data processing
* timezone conversion
* validation
* exception handling

### `config.py`

Handles:

* configuration
* API keys
* base URLs

This separation improves:

* maintainability
* scalability
* readability

---

# Virtual Environment

A dedicated virtual environment was created for dependency isolation.

## Create virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

## Activate virtual environment

### macOS / Linux

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

# Dependency Management

Dependencies are stored inside:

```bash
requirements.txt
```

Generated using:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Environment Variables & Security

Sensitive information like API keys should never be hardcoded directly inside source code.

This project uses a `.env` file:

```env
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Loaded securely using:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

Benefits:

* prevents secret exposure
* safer GitHub uploads
* production-style configuration management

---

# Timezone-Aware Programming

The API returns sunrise and sunset times as UNIX timestamps.

These timestamps are converted into proper local times using:

* UTC conversion
* timezone offsets
* datetime formatting

Example:

```python
datetime.fromtimestamp(..., UTC)
```

This ensures:

* correct international timings
* location-aware results
* timezone-safe processing

---

# Input Validation

The application validates user input before sending requests to the API.

Example:

```python
if not city.replace(" ", "").isalpha():
```

This prevents:

* invalid requests
* garbage input
* unnecessary API calls

---

# Logging System

A logging system was implemented instead of relying on simple print debugging.

Example:

```python
logging.info("Fetching weather data")
logging.error("Invalid city input")
```

Benefits:

* debugging
* monitoring
* execution tracking
* production-style diagnostics

---

# Exception Handling

Robust exception handling was implemented for safer execution.

Handled cases include:

* invalid city names
* API failures
* timeout errors
* network failures
* missing JSON fields
* unexpected runtime errors

Example:

```python
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
```

This prevents application crashes and improves reliability.
